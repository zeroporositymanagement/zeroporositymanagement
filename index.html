<h3>From the author</h3>
I consider myself fortunate to be associated with the manufacturing sector, which plays a critical role in the growth and development of economies and humanity.<br>
Working in this sector, I had the opportunity to observe, learn, devise and establish a managerial philosophy of attaining Zero Porosity into the overall work culture to make the manufacturing sector sustainable and profitable.<br>
This book is my gift to manufacturing businesses, especially those in the Die-Casting sector navigating severe challenges due to the world being in turmoil right now. Energy costs are rising. The pandemic continues to linger, and natural resources are depleting at an alarming rate. Regrettably, businesses face leaking profits despite their best efforts.<br>
Condensing my experience and learning into this book, I have shared all about the ZPM™ Ecosystem, including:<br>

- Current business challenges and their impact on your business and anticipated future<br>
- Saving million-dollar losses resulting from unresolved challenges<br>
- Structured method to minimizing porosity and maximizing business<br>
<br>
The book also comprehensively covers the significance of setting zero porosity as an ultimate goal for your company and using ZPM™  management framework to increase profitability.

<h3>Who should read this</h3>
This book is meant for top-level management, including owners, decision-makers & CXOs of global die-casting companies, senior managers, engineers, professionals from complementary industries such as plastic molding and metal casting. But it would be a good informative read even if you are not from die casting<br>

Porosity has got more to do with management and less to do with technologies and technicalities. It is about the decisions that you make. It is about the choices that you opt for.<br>

The intention of this book is to sensitize you to the limitless benefits of aspiring for zero porosity. <br>
